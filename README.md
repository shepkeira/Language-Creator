# Language-Creator

## Version 1

Translate from English into a made up language. (All translations are 1 to 1 right now)
Words kept in a dictionary

### Actions
* Can add or edit words from the dictionary
* Can enter a phrase and have it translated from English into made up language
* Will have choices for the initial language creation
  * Sounds found in language (must have some consonants and some vowels)
  * Homophones 0.2% average

## Ideas for further Versions
* Have language detections for formal nouns (person names, and names of places)
* Have language detection for word forms (plural, adjectives, nouns etc.) to make it less 1 to 1 translation
* Create written form for languages
* Add Diacritic
* Add tonal languages
* Add translation from other languages
* Add translation from made up language to other languages
* Add translation between made up languages
